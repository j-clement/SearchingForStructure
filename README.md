# SearchingForStructure
========

Python code for simulating the agent-based model which forms the basis for the following paper:

Clement, J., & Puranam, P. (2018). Searching for structure: Formal organization design as a guide to network evolution. Management Science, 64(8), 3879-3895.

The model can be extended in a number of ways to model the evolution of social networks with or without the influence of formal structure.

The code is not regularly maintained, which may lead to some (usually quickly fixable) module compatibility issues. The code was last updated in 2022 for numpy compatibility.


Installation
------------------------------------
The script has been tested with Python 3.7 (Anaconda Python Distribution - Windows 11 64-bit)

Required modules:
- numpy
- time
- datetime (but the code can be easily tweaked to only use the time module instead of this)
